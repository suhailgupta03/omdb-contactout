### Running The Application On Local
- Unzip the file _omdb-contactout.zip_
- Move inside the unzipped directory using the command `cd omdb-contactout`
- Run `npm ci` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the local development server
- If you want to host this on to a HTTP server, run `npm build` and then put the contents inside the `build` folder into the root directory of the HTTP server.
